# gan-projects

This repository contains side projects involving the building of Generative Adversarial networks following example [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/generative-adversarial-networks/). For example,

- Cosine GAN contains a GAN that is trained on a section of the cosine wave function and is able to generate similar.
- Fashion GAN contains a GAN for images of fashion items (shoes, clothes, etc.).
